#  Will Dirk Nowitzki be playing in the game? 

This is the big question as the Dallas Mavericks prepare to take on the Oklahoma City Thunder in their first playoff game of the season. Dirk Nowitzki, who is nursing a hamstring injury, did not participate in Wednesday’s practice and has been listed as doubtful for the game.

Nowitzki suffered the injury in Saturday’s game against the Houston Rockets. He left that game after scoring nine points in just under 15 minutes of play. The Mavericks went on to lose that game, 99-94.

The good news for the Mavericks is that they have already clinched a spot in the playoffs. This gives them some time to let Nowitzki rest and heal up before their next playoff series begins. 

If Nowitzki is unable to play on Thursday, then it will be up to Wesley Matthews, Harrison Barnes and Seth Curry to pick up the slack. All three of those players have been playing very well lately. It will be interesting to see how they do against one of the best teams in the NBA.

#  What will the score be at the end? 

The buildup to the World Cup has been dominated by talk of who will make the cut for the final 23 man squad. 

Gareth Southgate’s side are in good form, with four consecutive wins, and they will be looking to continue their winning streak when they take on Nigeria at Wembley on Saturday. 

Southgate has plenty of selection dilemmas to weigh up, but one man who is almost certain to start is captain Harry Kane. The Tottenham striker is currently the bookmakers’ favourite to win the Golden Boot, and he will be looking to add to his tally of 19 goals in 33 appearances for England. 

Kane is sure to receive plenty of support from his team-mates, but it will be up to them to provide the ammunition for him. Raheem Sterling had a sensational season with Manchester City, scoring 23 goals in all competitions, and he will be looking to continue his good form in Russia. 

England have a number of other attacking players who are capable of scoring goals, including Jesse Lingard, Dele Alli and Marcus Rashford. So what will the score be at the end? I’m going to predict that England will win 3-1 and that Harry Kane will score two of the goals.

#  Who will be the MVP of the game? 

This year’s Super Bowl is shaping up to be one for the ages. On one side, you have the high-flying Atlanta Falcons, who have put up points at an unprecedented rate this season. On the other, you have the New England Patriots, led by future Hall of Fame quarterback Tom Brady.

So who will be the MVP of the game? It’s tough to say, but there are a few contenders.

For the Falcons, quarterback Matt Ryan is definitely in the mix. He’s been on fire all year, and he has a slew of dangerous receivers at his disposal. If Atlanta can put up enough points to win, Ryan will almost certainly be the MVP.

The Patriots also have a few potential MVP candidates. Brady himself is always a threat, but running back Dion Lewis has been incredible this year, and could easily take home the award if New England wins.

In the end, it’s impossible to say for sure who will win MVP honors on Sunday. But it’s going to be a close contest, and any of these players could very well come out on top.

#  What team will win? 

The Super Bowl is coming up and everyone is wondering who will win. The teams that are in the running are the Patriots and the Rams. This is a hard question to answer, as both teams have some great players.

To start off, let's take a look at the Rams. The Rams have a really strong offense, led by Jared Goff. He had an amazing season last year, throwing for over 4,500 yards and 32 touchdowns. He also has Todd Gurley on his team, who is one of the best running backs in the league. Gurley had an incredible season last year, rushing for over 1,200 yards and scoring 19 touchdowns. The Rams also have a good defense, led by Aaron Donald. Donald is one of the best defenders in the league and was named Defensive Player of the Year in 2017.

Now let's take a look at the Patriots. The Patriots have a strong offense too, led by Tom Brady. Brady had another great season last year, throwing for over 4,000 yards and 27 touchdowns. He also has Rob Gronkowski on his team, who is one of the best tight ends in the league. Gronkowski had an amazing season last year, catching 79 passes for 1,084 yards and 8 touchdowns. The Patriots also have a good defense, led by Devin McCourty. McCourty is one of the best safeties in the league and was named Defensive Player of the Year in 2010.

So which team will win? It's hard to say for sure, but I think the Rams will come out on top. They have a really strong offense and a good defense, while the Patriots only have a strong offense.

#  Will it be a close game?

The college football season is in full swing and the matchups are getting more and more intense. This week, one of the most highly anticipated games will be taking place between the number ten Oklahoma Sooners and the number six Ohio State Buckeyes.

Both teams are coming into this game with high expectations. The Buckeyes have looked impressive so far this season, winning all of their games by large margins. The Sooners have had a bit more of a rocky start, but they still come into this game as the favorites.

The big question on everyone’s mind is whether this game will be a close matchup or not. On paper, it looks like the Buckeyes should have no trouble beating the Sooners. However, we have seen time and time again that anything can happen in college football.

This game is sure to be exciting and it is definitely one that you won’t want to miss. Make sure to tune in on Saturday to see which team comes out on top!
