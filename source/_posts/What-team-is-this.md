#  Why have they never lost a playoff game?

The Patriots dynasty has been one of the most successful in NFL history. They have never lost a playoff game since Tom Brady became their starting quarterback. So, what makes them so successful in the playoffs?

There are many reasons why the Patriots have been so successful in the playoffs. The first reason is their quarterback, Tom Brady. Brady is arguably the best quarterback in NFL history, and he always seems to play his best in the playoffs. He has won five Super Bowls and has led the Patriots to nine Super Bowl appearances. He is also a great leader, and he inspires his teammates to play their best in big games.

Another reason why the Patriots have been so successful in the playoffs is their defense. The Patriots have always had a strong defense, and they are especially tough to beat in the playoffs. Their defense is led by Bill Belichick, one of the best defensive coordinators in NFL history. Belichick is known for creating innovative defensive schemes that confuse opposing quarterbacks and receivers.

The final reason why the Patriots have been so successful in the playoffs is their coach, Bill Belichick. Belichick is one of the most successful coaches in NFL history, and he knows how to win playoff games. He has coached the Patriots to nine Super Bowl appearances and five Super Bowl victories. He is also a great motivator, and he gets his players to play their best when it matters most.

#  What are their prospects for the 2018-2019 season?

The Nashville Predators are coming off of a successful 2017-2018 season in which they made it all the way to the Stanley Cup Finals, but unfortunately lost to the Pittsburgh Penguins. Overall, the Predators had a great season and their prospects for the 2018-2019 season are looking good.

One of the things that will help the Predators be successful this season is their strong offense. They ranked third in the NHL in goals scored last season and they have a lot of talent up front, including Ryan Johansen, Filip Forsberg, Viktor Arvidsson, and P.K. Subban. The addition of Kyle Turris in the offseason should also help them offensively.

Defensively, the Predators were middle of the pack last season, but they have a lot of talent on that side of the ice too, including Roman Josi, Pekka Rinne, and Mattias Ekholm. They also signed Alexei Emelin in free agency, who will add some depth to their defense corps.

Overall, the Predators have a very talented team and should be one of the top contenders in the Western Conference this season.
