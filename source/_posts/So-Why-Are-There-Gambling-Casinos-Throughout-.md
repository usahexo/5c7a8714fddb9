#  So Why Are There Gambling Casinos Throughout? 

Gambling casinos exist in almost every US state, Guam, and Puerto Rico. Why? What is the draw? The answer to this question is complex, involving economics, sociology, and human nature.

Casinos are often seen as a form of entertainment. They provide a place for people to gamble, eat, drink, and socialize. Gambling is an adrenaline rush that can be addictive. People enjoy the excitement and sense of danger that comes with gambling. Casinos also offer convenience. They are open 24 hours a day and 365 days a year.

Casinos also make money for the states in which they are located. In fiscal year 2016, Nevada’s casinos generated over $11 billion in revenue. This money goes to the state government and is used to fund public projects such as schools and road repairs.

Casinos also create jobs. In Nevada, casinos employ over 150,000 people. These jobs include dealers, waitstaff, security personnel, and executives. Casinos are a major source of employment in many states.

Finally, casinos generate tax revenue for the state governments in which they are located. In fiscal year 2016, casino taxes generated over $1 billion in revenue for Nevada’s government. This money is used to pay for public services such as education and infrastructure maintenance.

#  Nevada Leads The Way In Gambling Casinos 

Las Vegas is not only the entertainment capital of the world, it is also the gambling capital. The state of Nevada has long been the leader in casino gambling and continues to be so. There are now more gambling casinos in Nevada than any other state.

Las Vegas and Reno are the most well-known gambling destinations in Nevada. However, there are many other smaller towns that have casinos as well. Wendover, Ely, Laughlin, and Mesquite all have gambling casinos.

The first casino in Las Vegas was the Thunderbird Hotel and Casino, which opened its doors in 1941. The most famous casino in Las Vegas is undoubtedly the Bellagio, which was built in 1998. The Bellagio features a large gaming area, several restaurants, a high-end shopping mall, and a world-famous dancing water show.

The first casino in Reno was the Mapes Hotel and Casino, which opened its doors in 1954. The most famous casino in Reno is undoubtedly Harrah’s, which was built in 1937. Harrah’s features a large gaming area, several restaurants, a hotel, and a conference center.

The first casino in Wendover was the Rainbow Club, which opened its doors in 1949. The most famous casino in Wendover is undoubtedly the Peppermill Resort Spa Casino, which was built in 1972.

#  Atlantic City Fights To Keep Its Casinos 

Atlantic City, long known as a gambling destination, is fighting to keep its casinos open. The city has been struggling in recent years as casino revenue declines. In an effort to bolster the city's finances, Governor Chris Christie has proposed closing two of the city's casinos.

The proposal has drawn heavily criticism from Atlantic City officials and casino workers. They argue that the closures would devastate the local economy and lead to job losses. The closures would also reduce the city's tax revenue by $200 million a year.

Atlantic City officials are working to come up with a plan that would keep the casinos open. So far, they have been unsuccessful. Governor Christie has said he will not back down on his proposal and is prepared to take over the city's government if necessary.

The future of Atlantic City's casinos is uncertain, but it is clear that they are facing a difficult battle.

#  Gambling addiction on the rise across casino floors 

Gambling addiction has been a topic of concern for years, but it seems to be getting worse. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, there are 6 million problem gamblers in the U.S. — and that number is only increasing. Casinos are reporting that they’re seeing more and more addicts, many of whom are spending thousands of dollars per visit.

While gambling addiction can happen to anyone, casinos are particularly concerned about targeting young people who may not realize the risks involved in gambling. Casinos have been known to use sophisticated marketing tactics to lure in new customers, and once people are addicted, it can be difficult to break the cycle.

There are a number of ways to deal with gambling addiction, but one of the most important is recognizing that you have a problem in the first place. If you think you or someone you know may be addicted to gambling, there are resources available to help.

#  Genting casino opens its doors in Cincinnati

After months of anticipation and speculation, Genting casino finally opened its doors in Cincinnati on Wednesday. The new casino is the sixth one to open in the state of Ohio and it is expected to create around 1,000 jobs.

The Cincinnati casino is a $300 million investment and it is the largest in the state. It has 2,000 slot machines and 75 table games. Genting also operates the Hard Rock Rocksino Northfield Park near Cleveland.

It has been a long time coming for Cincinnati, which lost its only casino when Horseshoe Casino moved to Cleveland in 2014. The new Genting casino will definitely help to fill that void.

Genting has been heavily marketing the new casino in the lead-up to its opening. It has offered free play days and other promotions to attract customers. And so far, it seems to be working as there was long lines at the doors on Wednesday when it opened.

There are already six casinos operating in Ohio, but Genting's Cincinnati casino is expected to be the most popular one. That's because it offers more games than any of the other casinos in the state. It also has a luxury hotel with 310 rooms and a spa.

The opening of Genting's Cincinnati casino is good news for the state's gambling industry. It is expected to generate over $200 million in revenue each year and create 1,000 jobs.
