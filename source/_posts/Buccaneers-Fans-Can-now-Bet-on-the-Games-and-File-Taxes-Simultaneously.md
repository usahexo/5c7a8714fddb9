1. Use Tax Software

Tax software can make filing your taxes much easier. There are a number of different programs available, so be sure to find one that is right for you. Most programs will ask you a series of questions about your income, deductions, and expenses. The program will then generate a return for you.

2. Get Organized

Organizing your tax information can save you time and money. Make sure to have all of your W-2s, 1099s, and other relevant documents handy. If you are missing any information, contact the appropriate party immediately. This will help ensure that your return is filed accurately and on time.

#  Football, Taxes, and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers

This year, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers boast one of the most exciting offenses in the NFL. Led by quarterback Jameis Winston, wide receivers Mike Evans and DeSean Jackson, and running back Doug Martin, the Bucs are primed for a breakout season.

Offseason moves like the acquisition of Jackson have many fans excited about what this team can do. However, one question remains: will the new-look Bucs be able to translate their on-field success into wins, and will they be able to do so without breaking the bank?

To answer these questions, we need to take a look at the team’s finances. In particular, we need to take a look at how player salaries and taxes impact the Bucs’ bottom line.

Let’s start with player salaries. The Buccaneers currently have a total salary cap hit of over $166 million. This number includes both active players and those on injured reserve. Of this total, Winston is by far the highest-paid player, earning a base salary of $20 million this season. Next up are Evans and Martin, who both earn over $7 million per year.

These large salaries present a challenge for the Buccaneers from a tax perspective. In order to avoid paying too much in taxes, the team needs to find ways to limit its taxable income. One way it does this is by signing players to contracts that include bonuses that are paid out in later years. This helps to spread out the team’s tax liability over multiple seasons.

Another way the Buccaneers minimize their tax burden is by setting up their front office in Florida. As a bonus for doing so, Florida offers a state income tax deduction for businesses that are headquartered in the state. This deduction helps to offset some of Florida’s relatively high corporate income tax rate.

Finally, the Buccaneers also receive some financial assistance from the NFL itself. The league provides teams with revenue sharing payments that help to offset certain costs like stadium construction or rent expenses. This money comes from shared national media contracts and ticket sales.

So what does all this mean for the Buccaneers? Well, it means that they can afford to sign players like Jackson and still remain competitive from a tax perspective. It also means that they may be able to afford even more big-name players in future seasons as their salary cap continues to grow.
