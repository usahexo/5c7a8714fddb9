# Precisely How to Play Lucky Day App Blackjack: A Guide for Brasileiro Serie A Fans

Lucky Day App is a popular mobile app that offers various games, including blackjack. Blackjack is a classic casino game that requires a mix of skill and luck to win. If you're a Brasileiro Serie A fan who wants to try your hand at blackjack on Lucky Day App, this guide is for you. In this article, we will provide a precise guide on how to play blackjack on Lucky Day App.

## The Basics of Blackjack

Before we dive into the Lucky Day App guide, let's review the basics of blackjack. In blackjack, the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. Each player is dealt two cards, and they have the option to "hit" and receive additional cards or "stand" and keep their current hand. The dealer also receives two cards, but one card is face down.

The value of the cards in blackjack is as follows:

- Ace: 1 or 11
- 2-10: face value
- Jack, Queen, King: 10

If a player's hand exceeds 21, they lose the game. If the dealer's hand exceeds 21, the player wins the game. If both the player and dealer have hands that are less than or equal to 21, the one with the highest hand value wins.
