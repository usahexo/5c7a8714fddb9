#  Parimatch reveals when your battery is running low on your internet casino game!

Russian internet casino game developer Parimatch has come up with a solution to one of the most nagging issues with modern gaming - informing players when their battery is running low on their devices.

The new feature, called "Low Battery Warning", will give players advance notice when their device's battery falls below 20%, so they can take the appropriate action to save their game progress.

The notification will appear as a pop-up message, and will include information on how much time is left before the battery runs out.

"This is an important addition to our games, as it gives players peace of mind that they won't lose any progress if their battery runs out," said Parimatch spokesperson Andrey Filippov.

"We're always looking for ways to improve the player experience, and this is just one of the ways we're doing that."

The new feature is currently being tested on Parimatch's popular internet casino game, Lucky Lady's Charm Deluxe.

#  Don't let your battery die while playing your favorite casino game!

Playing casino games on your phone can be a lot of fun, but it’s important to make sure your battery doesn’t die while you’re playing. If your phone goes dead, you could lose all your progress in the game and may not be able to continue playing.

Here are a few tips for avoiding battery drain while playing casino games:

-Turn off notifications: Many casino games include notifications that let you know when you’ve won or lost a bet. If you don’t need these notifications, turn them off so they don’t consume extra battery power.

- Dim your screen: The brightness of your screen can use up a lot of battery power, so dimming it can help conserve energy.

- Quit other apps: If you have other apps running in the background, they may be using up battery power without you realizing it. Quit any unnecessary apps to save energy.

- Use a power bank: If you’re going to be playing casino games for an extended period of time, consider using a power bank to keep your phone charged. This will help avoid any unwanted interruptions during your game.
