#  What is Dia Muertos?

Dia de Los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, is a Mexican holiday celebrated throughout Mexico and around the world in other cultures. The holiday focuses on gatherings of family and friends to pray for and remember loved ones who have died. It is celebrated on November 1st and 2nd.

Dia de Los Muertos is believed to have originated with the Aztecs. They believed that the dead traveled to the underworld, Mictlan, for a year. During their visit, they could be helped by the living through gifts of food, drink and flowers. Families would also gather together to tell stories about their loved ones who had passed away. After 12 months in Mictlan, the dead would be reborn and return to their families.

The holiday was brought to Mexico by the Spanish after their conquest of the Aztec Empire. Over time, it has evolved into its own unique celebration. Today, Dia de Los Muertos is a joyous event where people celebrate the lives of their loved ones who have passed away. Often times, families will create altars in their homes or burial sites dedicated to their ancestors. These altars are decorated with food, drinks, flowers and photos of the deceased.
