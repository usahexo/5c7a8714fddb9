#  What are the Olympian Gods?

The Olympian gods were a pantheon of 12 deities who ruled over the heavens and earth. The gods were: Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Demeter, Aphrodite, Ares, Hermes, Hephaestus, Athena, Apollo, Artemis and Dionysus. They were identified with natural phenomena and the human experience.

Zeus was the king of the gods and the god of thunder and lightning. He was often portrayed as a bearded man with a thunderbolt in his hand. Poseidon was the god of the sea and earthquakes. Hades was the god of death and the underworld. Demeter was the goddess of agriculture, fertility and motherhood. Aphrodite was the goddess of love and beauty. Ares was the god of war. Hermes was the messenger god and psychopomp. Hephaestus was the god of fire and blacksmiths. Athena was the goddess of wisdom, strategy and warfare. Apollo was the god of light, truth, music and healing. Artemis was the goddess of hunting, wilderness and childbirth. Dionysus was the god of wine, agriculture and ecstasy.

The Olympian gods lived in Mount Olympus, which overlooked Greece. They frequently intervened in human affairs to help or hinder them as they saw fit. They could be benevolent or destructive depending on their moods. They were worshipped by Greeks throughout Greece until Christianity became the dominant religion in AD 380.

#  What is the Olympian Gods Cuba?

The Olympian Gods Cuba is a religious movement that has its origins in the island country of Cuba. The group is based on the worship of the Greek gods and goddesses, and adherents believe that these deities can offer them protection and guidance. The Olympian Gods Cuba has been active since at least the early 2000s, and has grown in popularity in recent years.

The group's beliefs are based on those of ancient Greece, where the gods and goddesses were said to live on Mount Olympus. Members of the Olympian Gods Cuba consider these deities to be real, powerful beings who can help them with their problems and guide them on their path in life. The group holds regular ceremonies and rituals to honour the gods and goddesses, and also believes that physical representations of these deities (such as statues or paintings) can offer them protection and guidance.

The Olympian Gods Cuba has gained a significant following in recent years, with many Cubans looking for an alternative to the mainstream religious movements in the country. The group offers a sense of community and support to its members, and offers them an escape from the problems of everyday life. Whilst there is no formal leadership within the movement, it is understood that its founder is a woman known as "Maite".
