#  Hoffman Nets $4M in Mobile Casino Winnings!

On December 12th, 2018, Hoffman bilked a mobile casino out of $4M through a sophisticated cheating scheme.

Hoffman's scheme involved using malware to infect the casino's servers with software that controlled the outcome of games. Hoffman would then place bets on these games, knowing that he would win every time thanks to the malware.

This is not Hoffman's first time engaging in this type of behavior; he has been caught cheating at casinos multiple times in the past. In fact, it was his history of cheating that led casino security personnel to be extra vigilant when monitoring their servers for signs of infiltration.

Unfortunately for the casino, Hoffman was able to find a vulnerability in their security and exploit it. He is now a millionaire as a result of his successful scam.

While Hoffman's story is an interesting one, it serves as a reminder that casinos need to take measures to protect themselves from cheaters. Hoffman was only able to pull off this scam because the casino had not implemented proper security measures.
