#  Casino mogul reveals how long he's been online - and how it's made him billions

Casino mogul Steve Wynn has spoken out about his life as an online gambler – and how it’s made him billions.

The 72-year-old, who is the founder and CEO of Wynn Resorts, has revealed that he started gambling online in the early 1990s. And he says that it’s been responsible for most of his wealth.

“I was a pioneer of online gaming,” Wynn said in a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal. “I made a lot of money at it.”

Wynn claims that he was one of the first people to start playing casino games online, and that he quickly developed a lucrative strategy. He would often bet large sums on blackjack and other games, and says that he was rarely beaten.

In the early days, Wynn says that there were very few casinos offering games to players over the internet. But this soon changed, as the industry grew rapidly.

Today, there are hundreds of casinos catering to online gamers. And experts estimate that the global market for online gambling is now worth tens of billions of dollars each year.

Wynn Resorts is one of the biggest players in this market, and Steve Wynn himself is estimated to be worth around $3 billion. In fact, his net worth has increased significantly in recent years, thanks in part to his success in online gambling.

Despite his age, Wynn shows no signs of slowing down. He remains CEO of Wynn Resorts, and is currently involved in several major projects including a new casino resort in Las Vegas.
