When Unicaja Malaga secured the Liga ACB championship on Sunday, there was more than one way to celebrate. The club went out and won an exciting wrap-up game against Gran Canaria Las Palmas 87-81. Ending the season with a high note is important, and Unicaja was able to do just that.

There were obstacles to overcome in order to win this game. Gran Canaria led by as many as thirteen points during the first half of play. However, Unicaja battled back and took the lead in the fourth quarter. Nikola Mirotic led the comeback effort with 22 points, nine rebounds, and four assists. Alberto Abalde added 21 points of his own for the winners.

The final score may have been close, but Unicaja was in control for most of the game. They deserve credit for battling back and securing the victory on their home court. This is a team that knows how to win, and they proved it once again on Sunday.
