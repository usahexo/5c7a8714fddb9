- Always bet the maximum amount allowed on each hand. This will increase your potential payout if you win.

- Remember that the dealer must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 or more. Use this information to make informed decisions about when to take risks and when to hold back.

- Use basic strategy charts as a guide – these can be found online or in books about blackjack 21. However, remember that they are only meant as a starting point – adapting your gameplay according to the specific conditions of the table can sometimes give you an advantage over the dealer.
