#  How Much to Get Free Drinks on Carnival Queen of Treasure?

Few weeks ago, I was on Carnival Queen of Treasure cruise. And for the life of me, I could not figure out how much to get free drinks. 

It all started when we were given a drink package booklet when we boarded the ship. The booklet had all sorts of prices for different drinks packages. But there was no indication of how much each package cost. 

After doing a bit of research, I found out that the cheapest drink package option costs around $55 per person. And the most expensive option costs $149 per person. 

But what if you don't want to purchase a drink package? What's the price for individual drinks? 

Well, it turns out that the price for a soda is $2.50, while alcohol starts at around $7 per drink. 

So, what's the best way to get free drinks on Carnival Queen of Treasure? It really depends on how often you plan on drinking and how much money you're willing to spend. 

If you're only looking to enjoy a couple of drinks each day, then I would recommend purchasing the cheapest drink package option. This will give you unlimited soda and juices for the duration of your cruise. 

However, if you're looking to party hard every night then I would recommend purchasing the most expensive drink package option. This will give you unlimited alcohol for the duration of your cruise. Plus, it's worth mentioning that most of the alcohol on board is included in this package! 

In summary, here are your options for getting free drinks on board Carnival Queen of Treasure:
