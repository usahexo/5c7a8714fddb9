The holiday focuses on gatherings of family and friends to pray for and remember loved ones who have died. It is celebrated on November 1st and 2nd.</p>
<p>Dia de Los Muertos is believed to have originated with the Aztecs. They believed that the dead traveled to the underworld, Mictlan, for a year. During their visit, they could be helped by the living through gifts of food, drink and flowers. Families would also gather together to tell stories about their loved ones who had passed away. After 12 months in Mictlan, the dead would be reborn and return to their families.</p>
<p>The holiday was brought to Mexico by the Spanish after their conquest of the Aztec Empire. Over time, it has evolved into its own unique celebration. Today, Dia de Los Muertos is a joyous event where people celebrate the lives of their loved ones who have passed away. Often times, families will create altars in their homes or burial sites dedicated to their ancestors. These altars are decorated with food, drinks, flowers and photos of the deceased.</p>
<p>People also attend public events and parades where they can see traditional costumes and dances related to Dia de Los Muertos. Many people also enjoy eating special foods such as pan de muerto (bread of the dead) and calaveras (sugar skulls).</p>

<p>Why do we celebrate Dia de los Muertos?</p>

Dirk Nowitzki, who is nursing a hamstring injury, did not participate in Wednesday’s practice and has been listed as doubtful for the game.</p>
<p>Nowitzki suffered the injury in Saturday’s game against the Houston Rockets. He left that game after scoring nine points in just under 15 minutes of play. The Mavericks went on to lose that game, 99-94.</p>
<p>The good news for the Mavericks is that they have already clinched a spot in the playoffs. This gives them some time to let Nowitzki rest and heal up before their next playoff series begins. </p>
<p>If Nowitzki is unable to play on Thursday, then it will be up to Wesley Matthews, Harrison Barnes and Seth Curry to pick up the slack. All three of those players have been playing very well lately. It will be interesting to see how they do against one of the best teams in the NBA.</p>
<h1 id="What-will-the-score-be-at-the-end"><a href="#What-will-the-score-be-at-the-end" class="headerlink" title="What will the score be at the end?"></a>What will the score be at the end?</h1><p>The buildup to the World Cup has been dominated by talk of who will make the cut for the final 23 man squad. </p>
<p>Gareth Southgate’s side are in good form, with four consecutive wins, and they will be looking to continue their winning streak when they take on Nigeria at Wembley on Saturday. </p>
<p>Southgate has plenty of selection dilemmas to weigh up, but one man who is almost certain to start is captain Harry Kane. The Tottenham striker is currently the bookmakers’ favourite to win the Golden Boot, and he will be looking to add to his tally of 19 goals in 33 appearances for England. </p>
<p>Kane is sure to receive plenty of support from his team-mates, but it will be up to them to provide the ammunition for him. Raheem Sterling had a sensational season with Manchester City, scoring 23 goals in all competitions, and he will be looking to continue his good form in Russia. </p>
<p>England have a number of other attacking players who are capable of scoring goals, including Jesse Lingard, Dele Alli and Marcus Rashford. So what will the score be at the end? I’m going to predict that England will win 3-1 and that Harry Kane will score two of the goals.</p>
<h1 id="Who-will-be-the-MVP-of-the-game"><a href="#Who-will-be-the-MVP-of-the-game" class="headerlink" title="Who will be the MVP of the game?"></a>Who will be the MVP of the game?</h1><p>This year’s Super Bowl is shaping up to be one for the ages. On one side, you have the high-flying Atlanta Falcons, who have put up points at an unprecedented rate this season. On the other, you have the New England Patriots, led by future Hall of Fame quarterback Tom Brady.</p>
<p>So who will be the MVP of the game? It’s tough to say, but there are a few contenders.</p>
<p>For the Falcons, quarterback Matt Ryan is definitely in the mix. He’s been on fire all year, and he has a slew of dangerous receivers at his disposal. If Atlanta can put up enough points to win, Ryan will almost certainly be the MVP.</p>
<p>The Patriots also have a few potential MVP candidates. Brady himself is always a threat, but running back Dion Lewis has been incredible this year, and could easily take home the award if New England wins.</p>
<p>In the end, it’s impossible to say for sure who will win MVP honors on Sunday. But it’s going to be a close contest, and any of these players could very well come out on top.</p>
<h1 id="What-team-will-win"><a href="#What-team-will-win" class="headerlink" title="What team will win?"></a>What team will win?</h1><p>The Super Bowl is coming up and everyone is wondering who will win. The teams that are in the running are the Patriots and the Rams. This is a hard question to answer, as both teams have some great players.</p>
<p>To start off, let’s take a look at the Rams. The Rams have a really strong offense, led by Jared Goff. He had an amazing season last year, throwing for over 4,500 yards and 32 touchdowns. He also has Todd Gurley on his team, who is one of the best running backs in the league. Gurley had an incredible season last year, rushing for over 1,200 yards and scoring 19 touchdowns. The Rams also have a good defense, led by Aaron Donald. Donald is one of the best defenders in the league and was named Defensive Player of the Year in 2017.</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at the Patriots. The Patriots have a strong offense too, led by Tom Brady. Brady had another great season last year, throwing for over 4,000 yards and 27 touchdowns. He also has Rob Gronkowski on his team, who is one of the best tight ends in the league. Gronkowski had an amazing season last year, catching 79 passes for 1,084 yards and 8 touchdowns. The Patriots also have a good defense, led by Devin McCourty. McCourty is one of the best safeties in the league and was named Defensive Player of the Year in 2010.</p>
<p>So which team will win? It’s hard to say for sure, but I think the Rams will come out on top. They have a really strong offense and a good defense, while the Patriots only have a strong offense.</p>
<h1 id="Will-it-be-a-close-game"><a href="#Will-it-be-a-close-game" class="headerlink" title="Will it be a close game?"></a>Will it be a close game?</h1><p>The college football season is in full swing and the matchups are getting more and more intense. This week, one of the most highly anticipated games will be taking place between the number ten Oklahoma Sooners and the number six Ohio State Buckeyes.</p>
<p>Both teams are coming into this game with high expectations. The Buckeyes have looked impressive so far this season, winning all of their games by large margins. The Sooners have had a bit more of a rocky start, but they still come into this game as the favorites.</p>
<p>The big question on everyone’s mind is whether this game will be a close matchup or not. On paper, it looks like the Buckeyes should have no trouble beating the Sooners. However, we have seen time and time again that anything can happen in college football.</p>
<p>This game is sure to be exciting and it is definitely one that you won’t want to miss. Make sure to tune in on Saturday to see which team comes out on top!</p>

        <h1 id="What-team-is-this"><a href="#What-team-is-this" class="headerlink" title="What team is this?"></a>What team is this?</h1><p>Football is a team sport that has been played for centuries all over the world. It is a physical and tactical sport that requires a lot of teamwork to be successful. Two teams of eleven players each try to score goals by kicking a ball into the other team’s goal.</p>
<p>There are many different types of football, but the most common is association football, which is also known as soccer. In this article, we will discuss the different types of football, the history of the sport, and how it is played.</p>
<p>The word “football” comes from the medieval game “folk-ball”. Folk-ball was played with a ball made out of animal skin, and it was popular in England in the 12th century. The first written record of “football” comes from a court case in 1314, where two men were charged with playing the game illegally.</p>
<p>Association football began to be developed in the early 19th century. In 1848, John Charles Thring of Uppingham School devised an early set of rules for the game. These rules were published in 1863, and they formed the basis for modern association football.</p>
<p>In 1872, The Football Association was formed in England. This organisation is responsible for setting rules and regulations for association football. The first international match between England and Scotland was played in 1872, and association football began to spread around the world.</p>
<p>The first World Cup was held in Uruguay in 1930. This tournament featured 16 teams from around the world, and Uruguay won the tournament by defeating Argentina 4-2 in the final match. The World Cup has been held every four years since then, with the exception of 1942 and 1946 due to World War II.</p>
<p>The most common type of football is association football or soccer. Soccer is played with two teams of eleven players each on a rectangular pitch. The objective of the game is to score goals by kicking a ball into the other team’s goal. Soccer is governed by FIFA, which is an international organisation responsible for setting rules and regulations for soccer worldwide.</p>
<p>The first soccer World Cup was held in 1930, and Uruguay won the tournament by defeating Argentina 4-2 in the final match. The World Cup has been held every four years since then, except for 1942 and 1946 due to World War II. The most recent World Cup was held in Brazil in 2014, and Germany won by defeating Argentina 1-0 in extra time.</p>

It was founded in 1946 and is composed of 30 teams. The NBA is one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada.</p>

But when did they really start to shine?</p>
<p>The Warriors made it to the playoffs in 2013, but they were quickly eliminated by the Spurs. The following year, they made it all the way to the Conference Finals before losing to LeBron James and the Miami Heat.</p>
<p>But it was in 2015 that the Warriors really started to make a name for themselves. They set a new record for most wins in a season with 73, and they went on to win the championship by defeating the Cavaliers in six games.</p>
<p>In 2016, they repeated as champions by defeating the Thunder in seven games. And then in 2017, they set another new record by winning their third championship in four years.</p>

<p>The Warriors have an incredibly talented roster, with players like Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green. And their head coach Steve Kerr is one of the best in the business. He knows how to get the most out of his players and how to strategically win games.</p>
<p>The Warriors are also not afraid to take risks. They are always looking for ways to improve their team and keep up with the competition. In 2015, they signed Kevin Durant, which turned out to be an excellent decision. And in 2017, they broke NBA records by signing DeAndre Jordan during free agency.</p>
<p>Overall, the Golden State Warriors have become one of the best teams in NBA history thanks to their combination of talent, coaching, and risk-taking. They show no signs of slowing down anytime soon, and fans can expect many more championships from this incredible team!</p>
<h1 id="Why-have-they-never-lost-a-playoff-game"><a href="#Why-have-they-never-lost-a-playoff-game" class="headerlink" title="Why have they never lost a playoff game?"></a>Why have they never lost a playoff game?</h1><p>The Patriots dynasty has been one of the most successful in NFL history. They have never lost a playoff game since Tom Brady became their starting quarterback. So, what makes them so successful in the playoffs?</p>
<p>There are many reasons why the Patriots have been so successful in the playoffs. The first reason is their quarterback, Tom Brady. Brady is arguably the best quarterback in NFL history, and he always seems to play his best in the playoffs. He has won five Super Bowls and has led the Patriots to nine Super Bowl appearances. He is also a great leader, and he inspires his teammates to play their best in big games.</p>
<p>Another reason why the Patriots have been so successful in the playoffs is their defense. The Patriots have always had a strong defense, and they are especially tough to beat in the playoffs. Their defense is led by Bill Belichick, one of the best defensive coordinators in NFL history. Belichick is known for creating innovative defensive schemes that confuse opposing quarterbacks and receivers.</p>
<p>The final reason why the Patriots have been so successful in the playoffs is their coach, Bill Belichick. Belichick is one of the most successful coaches in NFL history, and he knows how to win playoff games. He has coached the Patriots to nine Super Bowl appearances and five Super Bowl victories. He is also a great motivator, and he gets his players to play their best when it matters most.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-their-prospects-for-the-2018-2019-season"><a href="#What-are-their-prospects-for-the-2018-2019-season" class="headerlink" title="What are their prospects for the 2018-2019 season?"></a>What are their prospects for the 2018-2019 season?</h1><p>The Nashville Predators are coming off of a successful 2017-2018 season in which they made it all the way to the Stanley Cup Finals, but unfortunately lost to the Pittsburgh Penguins. Overall, the Predators had a great season and their prospects for the 2018-2019 season are looking good.</p>
<p>One of the things that will help the Predators be successful this season is their strong offense. They ranked third in the NHL in goals scored last season and they have a lot of talent up front, including Ryan Johansen, Filip Forsberg, Viktor Arvidsson, and P.K. Subban. The addition of Kyle Turris in the offseason should also help them offensively.</p>
<p>Defensively, the Predators were middle of the pack last season, but they have a lot of talent on that side of the ice too, including Roman Josi, Pekka Rinne, and Mattias Ekholm. They also signed Alexei Emelin in free agency, who will add some depth to their defense corps.</p>
<p>Overall, the Predators have a very talented team and should be one of the top contenders in the Western Conference this season.</p>
