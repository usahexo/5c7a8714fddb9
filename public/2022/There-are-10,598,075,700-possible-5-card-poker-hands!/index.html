While there are many variations of the game, most poker hands consist of five card combinations. In fact, there are 10,598,075,700 possible 5 card poker hands!</p>
<p>That’s a lot of potential matchups and each one is unique. Out of all of those possibilities, however, only 169 different 5 card hands are considered to be “royal” or “elite.” That means that if you’re dealt any other combination of cards, you’re not in the running for the top prize.</p>
<p>So what are the odds of being dealt one of those elite hands? 1 in 635,039. That might seem like a lot but it’s actually pretty good odds when you consider that there are so many possible combinations.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that these odds apply to any form of poker - no matter how many players or how big the pot gets. The only time your chance of getting a royal changes is if the deck is reshuffled (which happens very rarely).</p>
<p>Now that you know the odds, it’s time to learn about the different types of royal poker hands. Here’s a quick look at some of the most common:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Royal flush: This is the #1 hand in poker and it consists of an Ace, King, Queen, Jack and Ten all from the same suit. As with any royal hand, it’s a pretty rare occurrence - happening only once in every 650,000 hands.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Straight flush: A straight flush is any five card hand that follows suit and all of the cards are sequential (e.g. 2-3-4-5-6). This type of hand occurs once in every 72,000 hands on average.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Four of a kind: Also known as quads, four of a kind is exactly what it sounds like - four cards of the same rank with one random card thrown in to make up a 5 card hand. This type of hand happens once in every 1,500 hands on average.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Poker-aficionados-can-now-compute-the-exact-odds-of-any-given-hand"><a href="#Poker-aficionados-can-now-compute-the-exact-odds-of-any-given-hand" class="headerlink" title="Poker aficionados can now compute the exact odds of any given hand!"></a>Poker aficionados can now compute the exact odds of any given hand!</h1><p>With the wide availability of poker calculators, one would think that all the information a player needs is at their fingertips. But this is not always the case. Most calculators can only tell you the odds of receiving a particular hand. Wouldn’t it be great if you could figure out the odds of getting any given hand?</p>
<p>Now there is an online poker calculator that can do just that! The Any Poker Odds Calculator tells you not only the odds of receiving a particular hand, but also the odds of getting any other hand. This is a big help for those players who like to play by intuition and not just according to strict mathematical odds.</p>
<p>The Any Poker Odds Calculator is easy to use. First, select the number of players in the game. Then click on “Deal.” This will generate a random five-card hand. To see the odds of getting any other hand, simply click on “Odds.” A list of all possible hands will appear, along with their respective odds.</p>
<p>This new poker calculator is sure to be a big hit among avid players. It gives them the ability to compute the exact odds for any given hand, which can help them make better strategic decisions while playing. So why wait? Start using the Any Poker Odds Calculator today!</p>
<h1 id="There-are-635-584-possible-straights-and-there-are-3-744-821-possible-four-of-a-kind"><a href="#There-are-635-584-possible-straights-and-there-are-3-744-821-possible-four-of-a-kind" class="headerlink" title="There are 635,584 possible straights and there are 3,744,821 possible four of a kind!"></a>There are 635,584 possible straights and there are 3,744,821 possible four of a kind!</h1><h2 id="The-Probability-of-Drawing-a-Straight"><a href="#The-Probability-of-Drawing-a-Straight" class="headerlink" title="The Probability of Drawing a Straight"></a>The Probability of Drawing a Straight</h2><p>If you are playing poker and are dealt five cards, the probability of drawing a straight is 1 in 635,584. This means that if you were to put all your money down on a straight, your odds of winning would be 1 in 635,584. However, since people rarely put all their money down on one hand, the odds of actually winning this bet are much lower.</p>
<p>To calculate the odds of winning a hand that involves a straight, we need to know two things: the number of possible straights and the number of total hands that can be made. The number of possible straights is 635,584since there are six different ways to draw a straight (Ace through Five). The number of total hands that can be made is 52 × 51 × 50 × 49 × 48 &#x3D; 3,744,821. This means that the probability of drawing a straight is 1 in 635,584 ÷ 3,744,821 or about 0.017%.</p>
<p>There are other hands in poker that are statistically more likely to occur than a straight. The four of a kind is one such hand. There are only three possible four of a kind (Ace through King), so the probability of drawing this hand is 3 in 3,744,821 or about 0.0008%.</p>
<h1 id="The-order-of-the-five-cards-is-important-in-poker-so-there-are-only-180-unique-5-card-hands"><a href="#The-order-of-the-five-cards-is-important-in-poker-so-there-are-only-180-unique-5-card-hands" class="headerlink" title="The order of the five cards is important in poker - so there are only 180 unique 5 card hands!"></a>The order of the five cards is important in poker - so there are only 180 unique 5 card hands!</h1><p>In poker, the order of cards is important - that’s why there are only 180 unique 5 card hands, when you select the best 5 out of 7 (or any other number).</p>
<p>There are 10,648 different 7 card hands, but only 180 of them are 5 card hands. How do we know this? Poker players and mathematicians have spent hundreds of hours trying to figure it out!</p>
<p>The five card hands are: royal flush, straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush, three of a kind, two pair, one pair and high card.</p>
<p>A royal flush is the best hand - it’s made up of an ace, king, queen, jack and ten from the same suit. A straight flush is next on the list - it’s five cards in order, all of the same suit. Then there’s four of a kind - four cards with the same rank. Full house is three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. Flush is five cards all of the same suit. Then there are three types of pairs: two pair (2 cards of one rank and 2 cards of another rank), one pair (2 cards with the same rank) and high card (the highest card in your hand).</p>
<p>If you’re playing poker with friends or family and you want to be sure that everyone gets a fair shake, use this chart to determine who wins!</p>

<p>If you want to test your skills and see how many of these poker hands you can make on a single hand then keep reading.</p>
<p>To make it a bit more fun, we will give you a specific amount of time to make as many hands as possible.</p>
<p>You have 3 minutes to make as many 5 card poker hands as possible!</p>
<p>Now go!<br>__</p>
<p>As we mentioned before, there are 10,000 different five card poker hands that can be made. In just 3 minutes, you should be able to create at least 100 different poker hands. If you’re feeling really ambitious, aim for around 500 different poker hands in 3 minutes!<br>Of course, the more practice you have and the better your skills are when it comes to making 5 card poker hands, the more likely you are to achieve this goal - but don’t get discouraged if it takes a little longer to make 100 different hands in 3 minutes. Just have some fun with it and see how many different poker hands you can come up with!</p>
